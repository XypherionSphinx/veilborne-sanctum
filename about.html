    <div class="section-text">
      <p>I walk between ruins and riddles, weaving silence into story. This world I’ve built — Veilborne Sanctum — is made of masks, but this page is not one of them.</p>
      <p><em>(Plain English: This is the ‘About Me’ page.)</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-block">
      <p>I go by many names online — the Crimson Veilborne, Hollow Thorn, and others — but behind them is one voice: a writer, worldbuilder, and artist exploring memory, identity, and myth through digital spaces.</p>

      <p>I build this site as both sanctuary and stage: a place where unfinished things still matter, where creation and ruin walk hand-in-hand. If you're here, you've wandered into something deeply personal. You're welcome to stay.</p>

      <p><strong>What this site is:</strong>  
      A digital shrine to everything I’ve made, forgotten, or never quite finished.  
      It’s also a portfolio, a storyworld, and a mask I speak through.</p>

      <p><strong>Tech stack?</strong>  
      Mostly HTML, CSS, and custom design. I may add JS, sound, or game systems later.</p>
